## Summary
 * Software development experience in small/medium/large commercial organisations, across multiple sectors - media, commercial, publishing, banking.
 * Happiest as part of an agile team, focussed on customer needs and delivering business value.
 * Previously Tech Lead on key customer-facing systems for the BBC - the power behind BBC iPlayer.
 * Previously Principal Dev and Team lead on the award-winning BBC Video Factory portfolio - bringing over a million hours of content to all devices.
 * Recent, relevant experience in Agile and DevOps environments, continuous integration/delivery (CI/CD) to Cloud platforms.
 * Ethos: _Each line of code has an ongoing cost, so write as little as possible, and keep everything else tidy. Tests are first-class code: Testability is a major part of design._

## Technical

### Development
 * General: Object-oriented, with a functional mindset. Focus on using TDD/BDD to drive clean, maintainable code.
 * DevOps: Containerization, (Docker/Kubernetes) to reduce distance between development and production.
 * Distributed systems: Breadth of experience developing high-volume transactional systems, and the issues. Scalability via Kubernetes and use of message brokers e.g. Kafka, ActiveMQ.
 * Java/JVM (10+ years): Oracle Certified Associate (Java 8). Spring ecosystem, Java (up to 21), Kotlin (1 year), Spring Boot, TDD/BDD (JUnit, Mockito, Cucumber-JVM), REST, Maven/Gradle.
 * Perl (10+ years): "Modern Perl" OO (Moose, Plack) - database apps, web services, data-processing (XML, JSON etc).
 * Other dynamic languages: Python, Groovy, Javascript, Ruby (varying experience)
 * Frontend: _I've been working with Web UIs throughout my career. Now I mainly maintain rather than develop because it's a massive field in itself. So I'm fine with HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, templating_
 * Relational databases: applications, schema design, query design and optimisation
 * "NoSQL" databases and key/value stores (e.g. DynamoDB, Redis, Memcached)

### Delivery
 * Distributed system architecture: observability, maintainability, API design, caching, volumetrics, microservices, performance testing.
 * Design and maintenance for monoliths, microservices and message-oriented systems.
 * Experience with migration projects - both system and data migration, done over extended periods.
 * Cloud (IaaS/PaaS):
    * AWS & Azure (architecture and implementation): Using comparable tech across both: Compute / Kubernetes / Queue / DB / IAM / Files / IaC
    * Experience with Azure Devops pipelines, deploying into AKS clusters, App Gateway, KeyVault.
 * Security: PKI; OAuth2; SSO (OpenID Connect) hashing, encryption/decryption, signing/verification with XML standards, some exposure to SAML.
 * Support software/systems: Jenkins, Maven, Gradle, Git, Jira, Confluence, Splunk

    * Also, I designed and helped to deliver a proof-of-concept gateway/security stack as a model for future development.
    * This also included making recommendations for the use of standards-based approach (e.g. OAuth2) rather than reimplementing old protocols.
  * By the end of this period, there was a clear path for onwards development which involved a strategy for deprecating the old
  gateway in favour of the new model.
