## Summary

I can offer in-depth experience of software development practice, from experience in small/medium/large commercial organisations, across multiple sectors - media, commercial, publishing, banking.  As such I can quickly adapt and bring different viewpoints to a new role.  Having also previously worked as a tech lead I'm able to advise on technical solutions for backend systems, devops practice, and software architecture. I have also worked as a team lead, so I am comfortable leading small teams.

Primarily, I'm looking for senior+ engineering roles rather than leadership but I am happy to bring all my experience to any role and the company culture.
