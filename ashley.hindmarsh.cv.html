<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>I can offer in-depth experience of software development practice, from experience in small/medium/large commercial organisations, across multiple sectors - media, commercial, publishing, banking. As such I can quickly adapt and bring different viewpoints to a new role. Having also previously worked as a tech lead I’m able to advise on technical solutions for backend systems, devops practice, and software architecture. I have also worked as a team lead, so I am comfortable leading small teams.</p>
<p>Primarily, I’m looking for senior+ engineering roles rather than leadership but I am happy to bring all my experience to any role and the company culture.</p>
